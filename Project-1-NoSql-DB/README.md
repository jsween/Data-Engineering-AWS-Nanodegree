# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra Project

This was the first project in the Data Engineering with AWS Nanodegree program. 

### Usage

1. Clone Project  
2. Either using Jupyter Notebooks through Anaconda or VS Code, launch the Project Notebook
3. Run all cells  

Note: I sampled the data to work locally. Not all data was downloaded. I modified the queries to capture data that is
in the sample data and not the full dataset. 

### Requirements

1. Python
2. Apache Cassandra
